// Day 2: Operators
// Tasks/Activities:


// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
// Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 20;
let sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(sum);

// Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
let sub = num1 - num2;
console.log(sub);

// Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
let mul = num1 * num2;
console.log(mul);

// Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
let div = num1 / num2;
console.log(div);

// Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
let rem = num1 % num2;
console.log(rem);


// Activity 2: Assignment Operators
// Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
let num3 = 10;
num3 += 5;
console.log(num3);

// Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
num3 -= 5;
console.log(num3);


// Activity 3: Comparison Operators
// Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.
console.log(num1 > num2);
console.log(num1 < num2);

// Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.
console.log(num1 >= num2);
console.log(num1 <= num2);

// Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.
console.log(num1 == num2);
console.log(num1 === num2);


// Activity 4: Logical Operators
// Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
let bool1 = true;
let bool2 = false;
console.log(bool1 && bool2);

// Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
console.log(bool1 || bool2);

// Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.
console.log(!bool1);


// Activity 5: Ternary Operator
// Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.
let num4 = -10;
let result = num4 > 0 ? "Positive" : "Negative";
console.log(result);


// Feature Request:
// 1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.

// 2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.

// 3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.


// Achievement:
// By the end of these activities, you will:
// Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
// Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
// Compare values using comparison operators.
// Combine conditions using logical operators.
// Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
